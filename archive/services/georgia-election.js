          Here’s an example of a candidate named <b>Linda Pritchett</b>’s
          campaign coverage. Linda ran for the Georgia State Senate District 39
          seat and this is a snippet from Vngle’s press conference for Linda
          Pritchett following a very public eviction during her campaign.

          After feeling unheard by the mainstream news outlets, she requested
          Vngle to exclusively share her response to being arrested after trying
          to retrieve her belongings following her eviction.
