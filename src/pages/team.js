            Vngle is a response to growing misinformation and
            underrepresentation that's plaguing so much of America.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our origin is rooted in grassroots work and seeing the systemic
            problems local communities face. This work started in Ferguson, MO,
            where social injustice is real but goes incredibly underreported.
            Ferguson like so many other underrepresented cities is a news
            desert, a place that gets little to no original reporting. Today,
            over 64% of America, millions of people, do not get daily original
            news on their area. These areas are where misinformation grows the
            most.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>
              We started Vngle to address these critical issues through
              empowering communities to bring various angles verified local news
              to their area.
